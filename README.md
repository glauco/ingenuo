# Ingenuo: a naive programming language classifier

## Why?

After watching Hilary Mason's course
[An Introduction to Machine Learning with Web Data](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920017493.do)
I wondered if it would be possible applying
[Naive Bayes](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html)
to the problem of classifying in which programming language a given source code is
written.

## How to setup the project?

```sh
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv .
$ source bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
